<title>Description:</title>

The purpose of this project is to provide a digital solution to the everyday problem of parking. Currently there is a problem with parking spots and parking lots, and the creation of ParkCore will help by providing an accurate and live map that displays the available parking spots. App users will easily be able to find a spot and get to their destination as quickly as possible.

<title>Key Metrics:</title>

1.) The time difference to park with and without the app.

2.) User Interface interpretation
- This will measure the functionality and concept of the app to see if users can easily navigate and interpret what our app does based off of the primary map view.

The images below are initial mock-up concepts of the to-be app:

<title>Sprint Review 1</title>

For Sprint Review 1 the initial mock-ups of the app were uploaded to UsabilityHub and a navigation test was created to measure how successfully users navigate the app. Displayed below are the heat maps of user clicks for the conducted test.

<img src="Heat map 2.png" alt="Selection hm" height=400>
<img src="Heat map 3.png" alt="Parking hm" height=400>

The percentage for users that successfully clicked in the designated hit zones of the app according the instruction provided are 98%, 76%, and 66.5% respectively for images 1 through 3.

The results from a brief survey completed to gather additional data from the navigation test participants are displayed below:
- 81% of users were able to successfully navigate the app until the end of the test
- On a scale from 1 to 5, user interface was given a rating of 4 and 5 by 87% of users
- 93% would tell their friends about this app
