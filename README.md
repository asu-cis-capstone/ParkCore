<title>Description:</title>

The purpose of this project is to provide a digital solution to the everyday problem of parking. Currently there is a problem with parking spots and parking lots, and the creation of ParkCore will help by providing an accurate and live map that displays the available parking spots. App users will easily be able to find a spot and get to their destination as quickly as possible.

<title>Key Metrics:</title>

1.) The time difference to park with and without the app.

2.) User Interface interpretation
- This will measure the functionality and concept of the app to see if users can easily navigate and interpret what our app does based off of the primary map view.

The images below are initial mock-up concepts of the to-be app:
