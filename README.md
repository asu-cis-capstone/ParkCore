<title>Description:</title>

The purpose of this project is to provide a digital solution to the everyday problem of parking. Currently there is a problem with parking spots and parking lots, and the creation of ParkCore will help by providing an accurate and live map that displays the available parking spots. App users will easily be able to find a spot and get to their destination as quickly as possible.

<title>Key Metrics:</title>

1.) The time difference to park with and without the app.

2.) User Interface interpretation
- This will measure the functionality and concept of the app to see if users can easily navigate and interpret what our app does based off of the primary map view.

The images below are initial mock-up concepts of the to-be app:

<title>Sprint Review 1</title>

For Sprint Review 1 the initial mock-ups of the app were uploaded to UsabilityHub and a navigation test was created to measure how successfully users navigate the app. Displayed below are the heat maps of user clicks for the conducted test.

The percentage for users that successfully clicked in the designated hit zones of the app according the instruction provided are 98%, 76%, and 66.5% respectively for images 1 through 3.

The results from a brief survey completed to gather additional data from the navigation test participants are displayed below:
- 81% of users were able to successfully navigate the app until the end of the test
- On a scale from 1 to 5, user interface was given a rating of 4 and 5 by 87% of users
- 93% would tell their friends about this app

<title>Sprint Review 2</title>

A real driving situation in conjunction with a paper prototype of the app was conducted to measure the parking appâ€™s efficiency. The experiment consisted of 2 independent drivers attempting to park in pre-determined locations, where one driver was equipped with the app prototype. A third drivers had found a parking spot in advance and had related that information to the driver using the app. In the experiment both drivers departed from the same location. Results are displayed below:

Test Location 1: From Taco Bell (Rural and Apache) to Mill Avenue
- Time to park without app: 7 minutes 12 seconds 
- Time to park with app: 5 minutes 29 seconds

Test Location 2: From Normal Dinner (Apache and Normal) to metered parking (between Rural and McAllister)
- Time to park without app: 3 minutes 18 seconds
- Time to park with app: 1 minutes 15 seconds

<title>Sprint Review 3</title>

A second iteration of the UI navigation test was completed on UsabilityHub to measure functionality for the latest version of the app created through Swift. A total of 12 responses were collected and the average duration for each user to navigate the app was 20.8 seconds. Heat map of the navigation test and the new app interface are displayed below:
